# ProjectKorraScrolls

**ProjectKorraScrolls** is a Minecraft plugin designed for servers using the [ProjectKorra](https://projectkorra.com/) bending plugin. It introduces an immersive progression mechanic where players must discover and collect "scrolls" to unlock bending abilities. These scrolls can be obtained through various in-game activities, adding depth and exploration to the bending experience.

---

## üåü Features

### üîì Ability Unlocking via Scrolls

* **Scroll Collection**: Players must gather a specific number of scrolls corresponding to an ability to unlock it.
* **Progress Tracking**: Each scroll read contributes to the unlocking progress of its respective ability.
* **Element-Specific Scrolls**: Generated scrolls can be filtered by the players' elements (e.g., Air, Water, Earth, Fire) and sub-elements (e.g., Lightning, Metal), ensuring players collect more scrolls relevant to their bending path.

### üß≠ Diverse Scroll Acquisition Methods

* **Mob Drops**: Hostile mobs have a configurable chance to drop scrolls upon defeat.
* **Loot Chests**: Scrolls can be found in naturally generated chests within structures.
* **Trial Vaults**: Special vaults that, when unlocked, guarantee scroll rewards.
* **Early Game Rewards**: New players receive scrolls for completing initial milestones like breaking their first log, sleeping in a bed, or planting a crop.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Extensive Configuration Options

* **Global Settings**: Adjust the overall behavior of scroll drops, loot generation, and trial rewards.
* **Ability-Specific Settings**: Fine-tune individual abilities with parameters like unlock count, drop eligibility, and loot weights.
* **Message Customization**: Personalize in-game messages related to scrolls and abilities.

### üìú Ability-Specific Configuration

Each ability has its own configuration file located in `/scrolls/<Element>/<Ability>.yml`. Here's an example for `AirBlast`:

```yaml
displayName: AirBlast
description:
  - '&7This scroll contains knowledge related to the ability &7AirBlast'
  - '&7Learn more about it using &8[&b/b help AirBlast&8]'

  Damage:
    type: additive
    value: 0.0
messages:
  consume: '&aYou read the %ability%&a scroll! &8[&e%progress%&7/&e%total%&8]'
  unlock: '&aYou''ve learned how to use &e%ability%&a!'
  alreadyUnlocked: '&cYou already know this ability!'
  abilityBound: '&7Unbind this ability with &8[&b/b clear %ability% %slot%&8]'
  slotAlreadyBound: '&7Bind it to an available slot with &8[&b/b bind %ability%&8]'
```

**Parameters Explained**:

* `displayName`: Custom display name for the scroll (defaults to ability name)
* `description`: List of description lines for the scroll
* `unlockCount`: Number of scrolls required to unlock the ability
* `maxReads`: Maximum number of times a scroll can be read after unlocking (0 = unlimited)
* `canDrop`: Determines if the scroll can drop from mobs
* `canLoot`: Determines if the scroll can be found in chests
* `canTrialLoot`: Determines if the scroll can be obtained from trial vaults
* `modelData`: Custom model data for resource pack integration
* `mobDropWeightBonus`: Increases the likelihood of the scroll dropping from mobs
* `structureLootWeightBonus`: Increases the likelihood of the scroll appearing in structure chests
* `trialLootWeightBonus`: Increases the likelihood of the scroll appearing in trial vaults
* `unlockedWeight`: Weight for scroll selection after the ability is unlocked
* `defaultWeight`: Base weight for scroll selection

**Attribute Scaling Types**:

Each attribute can have one of the following scaling types:

* `additive`: Fixed increment per level (e.g., +2.0 per level)
  * Formula: `baseValue + (configValue * postUnlockProgress)`
  * Example: If `value: 2.0`, each level adds 2.0 to the base value

* `multiplicative`: Percentage increase per level (e.g., +10% per level)
  * Formula: `baseValue * (1 + (configValue * postUnlockProgress))`
  * Example: If `value: 0.1`, each level adds 10% to the base value

* `exponential`: Compound increase per level (e.g., 10% compound per level)
  * Formula: `baseValue * (1 + configValue)^postUnlockProgress`
  * Example: If `value: 0.1`, each level multiplies the previous value by 1.1

* `NONE`: No scaling applied, same as additive: 0

**Messages**:

Custom messages for various scroll interactions. Available placeholders:
* `%ability%`: The ability name
* `%progress%`: Current progress towards unlocking
* `%total%`: Total scrolls needed to unlock
* `%slot%`: The slot number for binding messages

* **ProjectKorra**: 1.12.0
* **Minecraft Versions**: 1.21.4+

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

The ProjectKorraScrolls plugin is continuously evolving to enhance the bending experience on your server. Here's a glimpse into our upcoming plans:

### üîÑ Enhanced Compatibility with Core

* **Support for All Abilities**: We are still working to ensure full compatibility with all Core abilities. Very few abilities, like AirAgility, aren't compatible, yet.

### üõ†Ô∏è Overhaul of the Events System

* **Granular Control over Scroll Generation**: We're planning a comprehensive overhaul of the current events system to provide server owners with more precise control over scroll generation. This includes:

    * **Customizable Drop Conditions**: Define specific conditions under which scrolls can drop, such as time of day, biome, or player level.
    * **More Event-Based Triggers**: Introduce new event triggers for scroll generation, allowing for more dynamic and context-sensitive scroll drops.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and refine these features.
